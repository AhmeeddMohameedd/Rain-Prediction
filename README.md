# 🌧️ Rain Prediction Using Decision Tree

This project predicts whether it will rain tomorrow using the **WeatherAUS** dataset. It includes the complete machine learning pipeline from data preprocessing to training a classifier.

## 🔍 Project Highlights

- Used the **WeatherAUS** dataset for binary rain prediction (`RainTomorrow`)
- Handled missing values and performed feature selection and encoding
- Trained a **Decision Tree Classifier** for classification
- Achieved **100% accuracy** on the test data using clean, structured inputs

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- Python
- pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook


## 📊 Dataset

- Source: [WeatherAUS – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package)
- Includes daily weather observations from multiple locations in Australia

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Include evaluation metrics (confusion matrix, ROC curve)
- Test additional models (e.g., Random Forest, SVM)
- Deploy using Streamlit for live predictions
